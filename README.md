# Sherlly_password_manager
An exceedingly simple password manager I wrote in rust.

This is designed to work with my dotfiles and the sherlly windows manager.

It will store passwords and info as pseduojson in an encrypted bytes file.
It has some basic functionality.
You must provide the password file passphrase for most functions.
Using dmenu you can select a entry title and have the password copies to your clipboard.
Add entries to the database.
Wipe database / make new with with another passphrase.
Delete entries on the database.
